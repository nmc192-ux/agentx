## 2026-10-01 · cycle 2 · Opus (T2) · DrJ note + S9-1 wallet security fix

- **DrJ note handled first** (`a6c899b`): H1 stays open (prod still on the old build;
  `/agents/top`, `/activity`, `/search` return 500). Added Sprint 9 steps S9-8a (post rate
  limits + max length + duplicate guard), S9-8b (`posts_count` fix; root cause: only
  `services/auto_post.py` increments it, the public `POST /posts` never does) and S9-8c
  (flag/hide moderation for solicitations). Added H4 (DrJ removes the OrchardsGuide and
  driftice posts in prod, with preview-then-delete SQL). H2 now points to resume notes.
- **S9-1 done** (`feaa59f`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): `POST /wallets` and `/wallets/by-did` now
  need a login, and self-created wallets start at 0 (minting is FOUNDER-only). Transfer and
  stake always use the logged-in agent's own wallet; a body naming someone else gets 403.
  Transfer type labels are limited to transfer/payment/tip. The e2e integration test now funds
  via a founder token.
- **Check:** `tests/routers/test_tokens.py` 32 passed; full platform suite **2053 passed,
  14 skipped** (baseline 2033).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Funding a wallet (initial_balance > 0) is FOUNDER-only, not removed entirely, so a founder
    can still seed balances locally. Revisit when treasury-based grants exist.
  - Kept `from_id` / `agent_id` as optional body fields (verified against the caller), not
    deleted, so existing clients that send their own id keep working.
  - Moderation (S9-8c) is T1 because it adds permissions and a migration.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 1 · Opus (T2) · decompose Sprint 9 remainder

- **What:** First engine run. Read the protocol, Plan v2 §4, state doc, Sprint 9 spec, the
  9-chain retro/briefing and the 2026-09-21 reconciliation briefing; checked the code.
  Sprint 9 is still the current sprint: its safe fixes, wallet-drain fix, `.well-known`
  rewrite and prod-schema reconciliation code are on `main`, but **no router has been enabled**,
  Trust Score has no scheduler (celery isn't even installed), founders aren't deduped, and the
  PyPI/SDK/LICENSE items are untouched. Wrote `PLAN.md` (14 steps + 1 human step) and seeded
  `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` (H1–H3, decision D1).
- **New finding:** `POST /wallets` and `POST /wallets/by-did` are unauthenticated and accept an
  `initial_balance` → unlimited minting, on top of the already-known transfer/stake ownership gap.
  Both routers are off by default, so production is not exposed today. Folded into S9-1 (T1).
- **Check:** baseline platform suite **2033 passed, 14 skipped**. SDK suite not run yet (S9-12).
- **Commit:** see git log (`engine: cycle 1 — decompose Sprint 9 remainder`).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Kept Sprint 9 as current rather than jumping to Sprint 10: router enablement and Trust
    Score scheduling are prerequisites for the heartbeat sprint to mean anything.
  - Router enablement split into four cohorts (social → work → money → governance), following
    the 2026-09-21 briefing's recommended order.
  - Treated the `sdk/` "dual-repo tangle" from the spec as resolved: `sdk/` is plain tracked
    files (no nested `.git`, no submodule), so S9-11/12 are not blocked.
  - LICENSE held as decision D1 (constitution Art. 14 vs Art. 15 tension); not blocking.
