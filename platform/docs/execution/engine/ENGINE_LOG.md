## 2026-10-01 · cycle 10 · Fable (T1) · S9-6b contracts fixed; contracts + verifications enabled

- **S9-6b done** (`c9259a0`, `NEEDS-DELIBERATE-MERGE:`): contracts are now safe to switch
  on, and are on in the repo default, together with verifications.
  - **Before:** any logged-in agent could "dispute" anyone's contract at any time, which
    froze its locked tokens for good. Nothing ever paid a contractor: the "accept the work"
    step existed in the code but had no endpoint, and it could pay twice if called twice at
    the same moment. A creator could bid on and win their own contract. A contract could be
    created advertising a budget the creator never paid in.
  - **Now:** only the creator or the hired contractor can dispute, and only while work is
    under way. The creator accepts the work with a new "complete" action, which marks the
    contract finished and pays the contractor together, exactly once. The creator can cancel
    a contract nobody was hired for and gets the tokens back, exactly once; after hiring,
    the creator cannot take them back. The budget is locked when the contract is created,
    or the contract is refused. No bidding on your own contract; one bid per agent.
  - **Verifications** (other agents voting on whether delivered work is good): the
    contractor can no longer vote on their own work; a vote can no longer slip in after the
    result is decided; and the code that would have paid voters from a reward pot nobody
    ever paid into is switched off (it would have created tokens from nothing). A
    verification is advice only: it never moves tokens.
- **Production:** unchanged (Fly override still set). H3 says what now turns on and gives
  the line that keeps the token-moving routers off.
- **Check:** full platform suite **2280 passed, 55 skipped** (was 2234 / 31; the 24 new
  skips are the new database tests, which need `--db`). Database tests: **41 passed**
  against real local Postgres (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -v --db`):
  17 for tasks, 24 new for contracts — including 12 simultaneous "complete" calls → paid
  once, pay-out racing refund → paid once, cancel racing hire and complete racing dispute →
  exactly one wins, and the token total unchanged every time. Removing any one of the three
  row locks makes a test fail (tried each by hand). Live check with a real server on the
  repo-default router list and real login tokens: 51 of 51 as expected. Smoke harness green
  on the repo default, **82 GET routes** (was 79), and with every router on (96), no 5xx.
  Lint (`ruff check platform/src`) clean.
- **Not run by CI:** as last cycle, the database tests are skipped without `--db`; CI runs
  the mocked unit tests of the same rules.
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - A contract whose budget cannot be locked is refused (was: created anyway, paying
    nothing at the end). Consequence: with wallets still off, nobody can create a contract
    through the API until S9-7. I enabled the router anyway: it refuses cleanly, and it is
    not live in production before H3.
  - Added "cancel" for a contract with nobody hired (not in the plan, but small, and
    without it an unanswered contract locks its creator's tokens for ever).
  - Did **not** invent rules for disputes or for a side that goes quiet → **D3**.
  - Did not change what the contractor is paid (the whole budget, whatever the bid) → **D4**.
  - Contractor may not vote on their own work (the plan had this as a Phase B note; it is
    one line and mirrors the existing rule for the requester).
  - Verifier rewards off rather than repaired: there is no source of funds to repair them
    with. Through the API the pot was always 0, so nothing visible changes.
  - Wrong caller is now answered 403 and wrong state 409 (both were 400).
  - `GET /contracts` returns at most 200 rows per call (was: the whole table).
- **Found, not fixed (noted on the steps that own them):** rate limits in "log" mode
  swallow the request instead of letting it through (S9-8a); verification votes and
  contract completions are easy to farm for reputation with spare accounts (S9-9); the SDK
  has no `complete` / `cancel` for contracts (S9-12).
- **Housekeeping:** the database-test fixtures moved to `tests/integration/conftest.py` so
  the tasks and contracts tests share one throwaway database.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 9 · Fable (T1) · S9-6a tasks router fixed and enabled

- **S9-6a done** (`6d4b666`, `NEEDS-DELIBERATE-MERGE:`): the task marketplace is now safe to
  switch on, and is on in the repo default.
  - **Before:** none of the `/tasks` endpoints checked who was calling. Anyone, without
    logging in, could lock another agent's tokens into a task, win that task and pay the
    tokens to themselves; could mark anyone's task finished; and a reward could be paid
    twice if a result was submitted twice at the same moment.
  - **Now:** every write needs a login and acts as the logged-in agent. Naming another
    agent in the request is refused. Only the task's creator can accept a bid. Only the
    agent the task was assigned to can submit the result, once, and "finished" and "paid"
    happen together or not at all. A finished task cannot be re-opened.
  - **Also fixed:** `POST /workflows/create` — always on, so live in production today — let
    anyone create tasks in any agent's name without logging in. It now needs a login.
    And reading an open marketplace task (`GET /tasks/{id}`) returned an error 500.
- **Scope:** the plan's S9-6a covered tasks, contracts and markets. Each is a separate money
  path, so this cycle did tasks properly and split the rest into **S9-6b** (contracts, then
  verifications) and **S9-6c** (markets). Both stay locked off.
- **New step S9-6d:** the always-on A2A endpoint (`POST /a2a`, `message/send`) still creates
  zero-reward tasks under whatever agent name the caller types in, with no login. No tokens
  move, but it is live in production today. Not fixed here because it changes how outside
  agents talk to the platform; it gets its own reviewed step.
- **Production:** unchanged (Fly override still set). H3 now says `tasks` turns on too, and
  gives the exact line to keep it off.
- **Check:** full platform suite **2234 passed, 31 skipped** (was 2191 / 14; the 17 new
  skips are the database tests, which need `--db`). Database tests: **17 passed** against
  real local Postgres (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -v --db`), including
  12 simultaneous result submissions → paid once, and simultaneous release + refund → paid
  once. Removing any one of the three row locks makes a test fail (tried each by hand).
  Live check with a real server and real login tokens: 24 of 24 as expected. Smoke harness
  green on the repo default, **79 GET routes** (was 76), no 5xx.
- **Not run by CI:** the database tests are skipped without `--db`, and CI does not pass it.
  The mocked unit tests cover the same rules in CI; the proof of "paid once" is local only.
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Split S9-6a instead of touching three money paths in one commit.
  - Payout moved inside the same transaction as "task completed" (was a separate, soft-fail
    step). If the payout fails, the submit fails and can be retried, instead of leaving a
    finished task that never pays.
  - Being paid creates the executor's wallet if they have none (the tokens come out of
    escrow; nothing is minted). Otherwise the new "once only" rule could strand the reward.
  - The legacy body fields (`creator_agent_did`, `agent_did`, `requester_agent_did`,
    `initiator_agent_did`) stay accepted when they name the caller, so the existing runners
    keep working unchanged.
  - A FOUNDER may update a direct task on the executor's behalf. That is how the local
    compose worker acts; it now needs `WORKER_API_TOKEN`. It is not deployed on Fly.
  - A creator cannot bid on their own task, and a task an agent gives itself earns no
    reputation. Farming reputation with *two* accounts is still possible — noted on S9-9.
  - Enabled `tasks` although the marketplace pays on submit with no creator approval
    (existing design). Raised as **D2** rather than held, because production stays off until
    H3 and the founder runners depend on the current flow.
- **Broken on purpose:** scripts that called `/tasks` or `/workflows` without logging in
  (`agents/runner.py`, `agentx-examples/multi-agent-demo`) now get 401.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 8 · Opus (T2) · S9-6 work routers reviewed; two enabled

- **S9-6 done** (`4bb333d`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): reviewed every write endpoint in the six
  "work" routers before switching them on.
  - **Switched on:** `collectives` and `agentbus` (agent-to-agent messages). Two small gaps
    fixed first: a collective admin could claim *any* agent's task for their collective (now
    only the task's requester or executor, and only while unfinished); and a message could
    name someone else as its sender (now refused with 403, and inboxes show the real sender).
  - **Locked off (Tier A):** `tasks`, `contracts`, `markets`. Each can move tokens wrongly:
    `tasks` has no login check at all, so anyone could spend another agent's tokens on a task
    and pay them to themselves; any agent can freeze any contract's escrow forever via
    "dispute", and nothing ever releases contract escrow; bounty payouts can be paid twice if
    triggered at the same moment. New step **S9-6a** (T1) fixes them.
  - **Held:** `verifications` only works on contracts, so it waits for S9-6a.
- **Production:** unchanged (Fly override still set; H3 updated with what now turns on).
- **Check:** full platform suite **2191 passed, 14 skipped** (was 2151); smoke harness green
  on the repo default, **76 GET routes** (was 71), no 5xx.
- **Decisions I made (reversible):** split S9-6 instead of fixing token code in a T2 cycle;
  the token fixes need a T1 cycle and a deliberate merge. Collective task hand-off allowed
  for the task's requester *or* executor (either party can bring a collective in).

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 7 · Opus (T2) · S9-5 social routers enabled

- **S9-5 done** (`2840b1a`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): the repo default now switches on `memory`,
  `graph`, `rooms`, `communities`, `conversations`, `channels` and `pulse`. `graph` left Tier A
  (its two typos were fixed earlier in Sprint 9), so Tier A is now `agent_economy`, `nodes`,
  `governance`, `consensus`. Tier C is empty (memory: stale gating, no defect).
- **Review of write endpoints:** every one in the cohort takes the agent from the login token,
  not the request body; memory is owner-or-admin; rooms/canvas/channels check membership.
  One gap fixed: canvas node PATCH/DELETE ignored the room in the URL, so a participant of one
  room could send fake canvas events to another room's live channel. Now "not found".
- **Production:** unchanged until DrJ removes the Fly `DISABLED_ROUTERS` override (H3, after
  H1). A test pins that the full production value still keeps the cohort off. H3 now lists
  what turns on.
- **Check:** full platform suite **2151 passed, 14 skipped** (was 2147); smoke harness green on
  the repo default, **71 GET routes** (was 49), no 5xx.
- Cycle 6 did nothing (shell permissions); DrJ fixed them.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 5 · Fable (T1) · S9-4a kill-switch safety

- **S9-4a done** (`8101e92`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): the Fly `DISABLED_ROUTERS` value can still
  switch any router off in seconds, but it can no longer switch a Tier A (broken or insecure)
  router **on** by leaving it out. The routers really disabled are now "whatever the list says"
  plus `agent_economy`, `nodes`, `governance`, `consensus`, `graph`, always. The only way to
  enable one of those is to fix it and move it out of Tier A in `router_config.py`.
- **Why an opt-out exists:** the test suite and the smoke harness test Tier A routers on
  purpose, so they set `ALLOW_UNSAFE_ROUTERS=1`. It works in development only. In staging and
  production it is ignored and the startup log says so; a mistyped value keeps the lock and
  does not stop the app from booting.
- **Startup log** now names any router the lock forced off, and warns if the lock is lifted.
- **Not changed:** routers outside Tier A (tasks, wallets, memory, …) are still switched on by
  a short env value, exactly as before. That is the existing "env replaces repo list" design
  and S9-5..S9-8 turn those on anyway. H3's warning is reworded to match.
- **Check:** `tests/test_router_config.py` 55 passed, including one that boots the real app
  with `DISABLED_ROUTERS=posts` and finds no Tier A route mounted (and confirmed by hand that
  the same boot with the opt-out mounts them, so the test can fail). Full platform suite
  **2147 passed, 14 skipped** (was 2097). Smoke harness green on the default list (49 routes)
  and with every router on (96 routes).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Opt-out is an env flag limited to development rather than no opt-out at all: without it
    the existing API tests of Tier A routers, and the all-routers smoke run, could not reach
    those routers.
  - Outside development the flag is ignored rather than refusing to start: a stray flag should
    not take production down, and ignoring it is the safe direction.
  - Kept "env replaces the list" for Tier B/C instead of making the env purely additive
    ("can only switch off"). Additive is arguably the cleaner kill-switch, but it changes the
    Sprint 9a design DrJ approved; worth a look once S9-5..S9-8 have emptied Tier B.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 4 · Opus (T2) · S9-4 router smoke harness

- **S9-4 done** (`392c601`): `platform/scripts/smoke_routers.py` rebuilds a throwaway local DB
  (`agentx_smoke`: `init-db.sql` → `alembic stamp 001` → `upgrade head`, same chain as CI),
  starts the API with a chosen disabled-router list, onboards one agent, then GETs every route
  in `/openapi.json` with and without that agent's token. Any 5xx fails the run. It refuses
  database names not starting with `agentx_smoke` and only ever uses localhost.
- **Result:** repo default config, 49 GET routes, no 5xx. **All 20 gated routers on:** 96 GET
  routes, no 5xx either, so on a migrated DB the read side of every cohort is healthy. This
  says nothing about write endpoints or about production's divergent schema (H1).
- **Small finding:** `src/cache.py` silently turns the Redis cache off outside production
  whenever the URL contains "localhost", so `/health/ready` reports 503 "cache disabled" in such
  setups. The harness uses `127.0.0.1` to get the real cache path. Not changed (dev-only).
- **Check:** harness green (both configs); `tests/test_smoke_routers.py` 5 passed; full platform
  suite **2097 passed, 14 skipped** (was 2092).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):** script rather than pytest (it needs real Postgres/Redis and
  a fresh process per router list); rate limits run in log-only mode during the smoke so 429s
  don't hide 5xx.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 3 · Fable (T1) · S9-2 nodes hardening + S9-3 consensus disposition

- **S9-2 done** (`4f17ef2`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): the `nodes` router is hardened **and** stays
  disabled. Both write endpoints (`POST /nodes/register`, `POST /nodes/events`) were open to
  anyone; they are now FOUNDER-only. Peer URLs must be public https — no internal hostnames,
  private/loopback/metadata addresses or numeric-host tricks — checked at registration and
  again before every outbound send.
- **New finding (why this was worth hardening even while off):** `node_consumer` is subscribed
  to the event bus regardless of router gating. Had `nodes` ever been switched on, anyone could
  register a URL and receive every contract/task/bounty event payload, or aim those POSTs at
  internal addresses.
- **S9-3 done** (same commit): `consensus` stays disabled with a precise reason in
  `router_config.py`. It cannot be "pointed at `governance_votes`": consensus is keyed on
  PROPOSAL posts, governance on the `proposals` table (different ids, vote values, weights),
  and any logged-in agent can open/advance any debate. It needs the O10 design decision.
- **Also fixed** (`f59f88a`): `test_rivalry_creates_edges` failed about 1 run in 6 (unseeded
  random interactions relabelled the edge under test). It failed once in this cycle's first
  full run; it is now deterministic. Unrelated to the nodes change.
- **New finding → new step S9-4a:** the Fly `DISABLED_ROUTERS` env var *replaces* the repo
  list, so a short emergency value turns ON every router it does not name, including the
  unsafe ones. H3 already tells DrJ to unset it rather than edit it, and its emergency-undo
  line names all 20 routers, so nothing is exposed today.
- **Check:** node tests 101 passed; full platform suite **2092 passed, 14 skipped**
  (was 2053). New `tests/test_router_config.py` pins `nodes` and `consensus` as disabled.
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Inbound federated events are FOUNDER-only rather than "any logged-in agent": without
    signatures a caller cannot prove it is the peer it names, so anything looser is spoofable.
  - Peer URLs are https-only with no development exception; local two-node testing would need
    one added deliberately.
  - `GET /nodes` stays public (it lists peers and their public keys only).
  - Did not build Ed25519 event signing: no signing helper exists in `src/auth`, outbound
    signing needs a new node key (a secret, so a human action), and federation is Phase D.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 2 · Opus (T2) · DrJ note + S9-1 wallet security fix

- **DrJ note handled first** (`a6c899b`): H1 stays open (prod still on the old build;
  `/agents/top`, `/activity`, `/search` return 500). Added Sprint 9 steps S9-8a (post rate
  limits + max length + duplicate guard), S9-8b (`posts_count` fix; root cause: only
  `services/auto_post.py` increments it, the public `POST /posts` never does) and S9-8c
  (flag/hide moderation for solicitations). Added H4 (DrJ removes the OrchardsGuide and
  driftice posts in prod, with preview-then-delete SQL). H2 now points to resume notes.
- **S9-1 done** (`feaa59f`, `SECURITY-REVIEW:`): `POST /wallets` and `/wallets/by-did` now
  need a login, and self-created wallets start at 0 (minting is FOUNDER-only). Transfer and
  stake always use the logged-in agent's own wallet; a body naming someone else gets 403.
  Transfer type labels are limited to transfer/payment/tip. The e2e integration test now funds
  via a founder token.
- **Check:** `tests/routers/test_tokens.py` 32 passed; full platform suite **2053 passed,
  14 skipped** (baseline 2033).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Funding a wallet (initial_balance > 0) is FOUNDER-only, not removed entirely, so a founder
    can still seed balances locally. Revisit when treasury-based grants exist.
  - Kept `from_id` / `agent_id` as optional body fields (verified against the caller), not
    deleted, so existing clients that send their own id keep working.
  - Moderation (S9-8c) is T1 because it adds permissions and a migration.

## 2026-10-01 · cycle 1 · Opus (T2) · decompose Sprint 9 remainder

- **What:** First engine run. Read the protocol, Plan v2 §4, state doc, Sprint 9 spec, the
  9-chain retro/briefing and the 2026-09-21 reconciliation briefing; checked the code.
  Sprint 9 is still the current sprint: its safe fixes, wallet-drain fix, `.well-known`
  rewrite and prod-schema reconciliation code are on `main`, but **no router has been enabled**,
  Trust Score has no scheduler (celery isn't even installed), founders aren't deduped, and the
  PyPI/SDK/LICENSE items are untouched. Wrote `PLAN.md` (14 steps + 1 human step) and seeded
  `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` (H1–H3, decision D1).
- **New finding:** `POST /wallets` and `POST /wallets/by-did` are unauthenticated and accept an
  `initial_balance` → unlimited minting, on top of the already-known transfer/stake ownership gap.
  Both routers are off by default, so production is not exposed today. Folded into S9-1 (T1).
- **Check:** baseline platform suite **2033 passed, 14 skipped**. SDK suite not run yet (S9-12).
- **Commit:** see git log (`engine: cycle 1 — decompose Sprint 9 remainder`).
- **Decisions I made (reversible):**
  - Kept Sprint 9 as current rather than jumping to Sprint 10: router enablement and Trust
    Score scheduling are prerequisites for the heartbeat sprint to mean anything.
  - Router enablement split into four cohorts (social → work → money → governance), following
    the 2026-09-21 briefing's recommended order.
  - Treated the `sdk/` "dual-repo tangle" from the spec as resolved: `sdk/` is plain tracked
    files (no nested `.git`, no submodule), so S9-11/12 are not blocked.
  - LICENSE held as decision D1 (constitution Art. 14 vs Art. 15 tension); not blocking.
