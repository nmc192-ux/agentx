# Human actions — things only DrJ can do

Newest first. Tick the box when done; the engine reads this file every cycle.

- [ ] **D1 — Decide the licence for the platform repo (one line answer).**
  Magna Carta Art. 15 says "Apache 2.0 for both repos", but Art. 14 says the Trust Score
  *implementation*, governance algorithms and matching logic are proprietary — and they live in
  this (public) platform repo. Also, `sdk/LICENSE` is currently **MIT**, not Apache 2.0.
  Options: (a) Apache 2.0 on the whole platform repo as Art. 15 says; (b) Apache 2.0 on `sdk/`
  and protocol/schemas only (the root README currently says "MIT"), platform code "all rights reserved" until the protocol is split out;
  (c) Apache 2.0 everywhere now, move proprietary pieces out later.
  **Engine recommendation: (a)** — it is what the constitution literally says, and the code is
  already public, so a licence mainly clarifies terms; revisit when the protocol spec separates.
  Reply in `ENGINE_LOG.md` notes or a note to the engine: "D1: a" / "D1: b" / "D1: c".
  Unblocks: S9-13 (LICENSE files, a Phase A exit criterion).

- [ ] **H3 — After H1, switch production to the repo's router list.**
  Only after H1 is done and the router-enablement commits from this branch are merged.
  Fly.io's `DISABLED_ROUTERS` secret overrides the repo list, so production ignores repo changes
  while it is set. On your own computer, in a terminal:
  ```
  fly secrets list -a agentx-platform
  ```
  If `DISABLED_ROUTERS` is listed, remove it (the app restarts automatically):
  ```
  fly secrets unset DISABLED_ROUTERS -a agentx-platform
  ```
  Then open `https://agentx-platform.fly.dev/health` — it should say `"status": "ok"`.
  Emergency undo (turns everything back off in seconds):
  `fly secrets set DISABLED_ROUTERS="agent_economy,nodes,governance,consensus,graph,tasks,collectives,communities,contracts,wallets,stakes,economy,agentbus,verifications,markets,conversations,channels,rooms,pulse,memory" -a agentx-platform`
  Unblocks: routers going live on agentx.social.

- [ ] **H2 — Tell the engine whether H1 is done.**
  Add a line under "Notes from DrJ" at the bottom of this file, e.g.
  `2026-10-02: H1 done, alembic_version = 040, /agents/top = 200`.
  The engine has no production access and cannot check this itself.

- [ ] **H1 — Run the production schema reconciliation (if not already done).**
  The code merged on 2026-09-22 (PR #10). The runbook is in
  `platform/docs/sprints/briefing_2026-09-21_reconciliation.md`, section "Deploy runbook".
  Short version: in the Neon console SQL editor on the production branch, first check
  `SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;`
  — if it already says `040`, it is done; skip the rest. If it says `037`, run
  `UPDATE alembic_version SET version_num = '001';`
  then re-run the latest production deploy (GitHub → Actions → Deploy → approve
  "Deploy to Production"). Afterwards `https://agentx-platform.fly.dev/agents/top` should load
  (not an error). Safety net: Neon snapshot `pre-reconciliation-2026-09-21`.
  Unblocks: every router enablement in production.
